# memorable-introduction
Hello! Welcome to Jack Jacobs' git

I'm a British he/him pronoun that grew up in Malaysia. 
I'm looking to work in the budding field of computational biology and bioinformatics.
*Independent learning* and *problem solving* are my two **strong** points.

Anyway, in this git I'll be sharing examples of code and analysis that I worked on during my PhD on an epigenetic repressor, PRC2.
